Lets say you want to bring your device out of a factory default state

you will use the following test scripts:


#### Taking ownership of the device in NORMAL mode ####
./ownership.sh (Sets admin CPIN to abcdefg)
./activatelsp.sh (Activates the Locking SP in NORMAL mode)
./setuplrs.sh (Sets up 5 Locking ranges in normal mode)
./enable-users.sh (Enables 5 users in the Locking SP)
./add_users_to_lrs.sh (adds user1 to lr 1, user 2 to user2, etc (gives them permission to Unlock/Lock as RW))

./set-user-pws.sh (Sets the user passwords to "bla" via the Admin1 Locking SP authority)



./users_lock_ranges.sh (Locks each locking range)
./users_unlock_ranges.sh (unlocks each locking range)

./save-users (Saves the user passwords for replay upon resume from suspend)



#### Taking Ownership in Single User Mode #####

./ownership.sh
./activatelsp_SUM.sh
./setuplrs_SUM.sh
./set-user-pws-SUM.sh
